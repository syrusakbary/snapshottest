Snapshot testing is a way to test your APIs without writing actual test cases.

1. A snapshot is a single state of your API, saved in a file.
2. You have a set of snapshots for your API endpoints.
3. Once you add a new feature, you can generate *automatically* new snapshots for the updated API.

## Installation

    $ pip install snapshottest


## Usage with unittest/nose

```python
from snapshottest import TestCase

class APITestCase(TestCase):
    def test_api_me(self):
        """Testing the API for /me"""
        my_api_response = api.client.get('/me')
        self.assertMatchSnapshot(my_api_response)

        # Set custom snapshot name: `gpg_response`
        my_gpg_response = api.client.get('/me?gpg_key')
        self.assertMatchSnapshot(my_gpg_response, 'gpg_response')
```

You'll also need to let your test runner know about snapshottest,
to summarize the snapshot results and handle removing unused snapshots:
* If your code calls `unittest.main()`, replace that with `snapshottest.main()`
* If you run `python -m unittest ...`, switch to `python -m snapshottest ...`
* If you use nose, snapshottest automatically loads a nose plugin
  that handles this for you 
* Or if you have a custom unittest TestRunner, add 
  `snapshottest.unittest.SnapshotTestRunnerMixin` (see its docstring for more info)

To generate new snapshots, add `--snapshot-update` to your usual test command line 
(e.g., `python -m snapshottest ... --snapshot-update` or `nosetests --snapshot-update`). 

Check the [Unittest example](https://github.com/syrusakbary/snapshottest/tree/master/examples/unittest).


## Usage with pytest

```python
def test_mything(snapshot):
    """Testing the API for /me"""
    my_api_response = api.client.get('/me')
    snapshot.assert_match(my_api_response)

    # Set custom snapshot name: `gpg_response`
    my_gpg_response = api.client.get('/me?gpg_key')
    snapshot.assert_match(my_gpg_response, 'gpg_response')
```

If you want to update the snapshots automatically you can use the `--snapshot-update` config.

Check the [Pytest example](https://github.com/syrusakbary/snapshottest/tree/master/examples/pytest).

## Usage with django
Add to your settings:
```python
TEST_RUNNER = 'snapshottest.django.TestRunner'
```
To create your snapshottest:
```python
from snapshottest.django import TestCase

class APITestCase(TestCase):
    def test_api_me(self):
        """Testing the API for /me"""
        my_api_response = api.client.get('/me')
        self.assertMatchSnapshot(my_api_response)
```
If you want to update the snapshots automatically you can use the `python manage.py test --snapshot-update`.
Check the [Django example](https://github.com/syrusakbary/snapshottest/tree/master/examples/django_project).

## Disabling terminal colors

Set the environment variable `ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED` (to any value), e.g. 

    ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED=1 pytest


# Contributing

After cloning this repo and configuring a virtualenv for snapshottest (optional, but highly recommended), ensure dependencies are installed by running:

```sh
make develop
```

After developing, ensure your code is formatted properly by running:
 
```sh
make format-fix
```

and then run the full test suite with:

```sh
make lint
# and
make test
```

To test locally on all supported Python versions, you can use 
[tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/):

```sh
pip install tox  # (if you haven't before)
tox
```

# Notes

This package is heavily inspired in [jest snapshot testing](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/snapshot-testing.html).

# Reasons to use this package

> Most of this content is taken from the [Jest snapshot blogpost](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html).

We want to make it as frictionless as possible to write good tests that are useful.
We observed that when engineers are provided with ready-to-use tools, they end up writing more tests, which in turn results in stable and healthy code bases.

However engineers frequently spend more time writing a test than the component itself. As a result many people stopped writing tests altogether which eventually led to instabilities.

A typical snapshot test case for a mobile app renders a UI component, takes a screenshot, then compares it to a reference image stored alongside the test. The test will fail if the two images do not match: either the change is unexpected, or the screenshot needs to be updated to the new version of the UI component.


## Snapshot Testing with SnapshotTest

A similar approach can be taken when it comes to testing your APIs.
Instead of rendering the graphical UI, which would require building the entire app, you can use a test renderer to quickly generate a serializable value for your API response.
